Project Overview
============
This project was created to practice my skills in making responsive web pages. 
This is a responsive Webpage for an online newspaper that is accessible and convenient for any user to find out about the most important news of the day in a matter of seconds. It contains all the sections that a print newspaper would contain from sports section up til the weather section with its added perks of being updateable at anytime of the day as soon as any incident happens.
